Hi, I'm Lewis, or more commonly known online as LewisTehMinerz. You've probably found me from my
website or [GitHub](https://github.com/LewisTehMinerz).

I develop (obviously) with many tools and languages and I am constantly experimenting with more. I
haven't written a killer project yet, but maybe one day I will.
