*This post is related to a college assignment about writing a blog post regarding barriers to effective communication.*

When engaging in conversation with a person or audience, there are many barriers to communication that you have to keep in mind to
preserve effective communication.

# Language Barrier
Not being able to speak the language that your audience uses means that they will not understand what you say.

Interpreters can help get over this issue but learning the language itself will help engage your audience more as they won’t have
to keep swapping between speakers.

# Auditory
People will not be able to hear you if they are deaf. A sign language interpreter will help them understand your communication.

# Incoherence
Mumbling, stuttering, and slurring your speech can make it completely incoherent and your audience will not be able to understand
you.

# Disengagement
If your audience is not engaged with the communication, they will not absorb information or bother listening.

# Distractions
If you are attempting to establish communication in a distracting environment, your audience may be more interested in other
things if you don’t make your communication engaging.

# Multimedia
If your communication doesn’t have multimedia (images, videos, audio) your audience may become disengaged with it.

# Body Language
If your audience sees your body language as negative, they will become disengaged.

# Informal Language
Usage of words such as slang words can result in your communication being unintelligible for certain people who do not know what
the slang means.

# Unorganisaed
If you are stumbling through your communication because you never organised it or planned, your audience will not take you
seriously and will disengage.

# Unpresentable
Without a proper presentation set up, your audience will not understand your communication well and may even completely
misunderstand what you say.
